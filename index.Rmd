Welcome to *Concepts & Applications in Spatial Epidemiology (EPI 563)*! This eBook is one of several sources of information and support for your progress through the semester. For an overview of the course, expectations, learning objectives, assignments, and grading, please review the full course syllabus on Canvas. This eBook serves to provide a *'jumping off point'* for the content to be covered each week. Specifically, the content herein will introduce key themes, new vocabulary, and provide some additional detail that is complementary to the *asynchronous* (pre-recorded) video lectures, and foundational to the *synchronous* (in class) work. 

## Strategy for using this eBook {-}

There is a separate *module* or *chapter* for each week's content. In general, the content within each week's section is divided into two sections focusing on **spatial thinking** and **spatial analysis**. This dichotomy does not always hold, but in broad terms you can expect these sections to be more specific to content in class on *Tuesday* versus *Thursday* respectively.

* *Spatial thinking for epidemiology*: This section introduces vocabulary, concepts, and themes that are important to the incorporation of spatialized or geo-referenced data into epidemiologic work. At a minimum, plan to read this content prior to class Tuesday, although you will likely benefit from reading both sections before Tuesday.
* *Spatial analysis for epidemiology*: This section is more focused on data management, visualization, spatial statistics, and interpretation. This content is relevant for our work together on Tuesday's, but is essential for successful work in the Thursday lab activities. 

Please note that I will be continually updating the eBook throughout the semester, so if you choose to download, please double-check the **Last updated** date to be sure you have the most recent version.

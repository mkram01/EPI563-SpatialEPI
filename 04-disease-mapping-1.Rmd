## Spatial Thinking in Epidemiology, w4

*Disease mapping* is located at the intersection of statistics, geography, and epidemiology. Whereas the out-of-the-box GIS approach to making maps of health statistics (e.g. what I've been referring to as *epidemiologic cartography*) takes raw data and simply shows it on a map, disease mapping typically implies that we are interested in going beyond just making pretty maps.  Instead we are driven by core *epidemiologic questions* and concerned about fundamental *epidemiologic and statistical issues*.

### Why do we need disease mapping?

The defining driver or purpose of epidemiology is an interest in characterizing and estimating the distribution and determinants of health in populations. Disease mapping is primarily focused on the former (distribution of health), providing novel insight into the geographic patterns of health and disease.  The latter (determinants of health) can begin to be addressed by Modules 3 and 4 of this course focusing on Clustering and Spatial Regression.

To *spatially describe* the distribution of disease, epidemiologists are primarily interested in one over-arching question:

>**Is the intensity of disease or health spatially heterogeneous or spatially homogenous?**

*Spatial heterogeneity* simply implies that the *global parameter* (e.g. rate, risk, prevalence, etc) for an entire study area is not identical to the *local parameter* in every sub-region of that study area.  In contrast, *spatial homogeneity* means that if you know the overall, global parameter, you basically know every local parameter, plus or minus random variation. Looking for  heterogeneity is the whole reason for mapping. If the occurrence of disease were the same everywhere, a map would not tell us much!  In previous weeks we mapped disease, but our epidemiologic cartography efforts to date fall short because we did not attend to the following three challenges: 

1. Parameter estimate instability due to sparse data/rare events;
2. Spurious heterogeneity arising from '*confounding*' by nuisance covariates;
3. Biased description of spatial heterogeneity arising from the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP), a form of the ecologic fallacy

#### The problem and approach to data sparsity

Reliable and precise estimation of any parameter presumes we have sufficient data to produce a summary (e.g. a measure of central tendency like a mean, prevalence, risk, etc). When either a disease is quite rare -- resulting in a small numerator -- or the population at risk is quite sparse -- resulting in a small denominator -- the estimate of disease burden is inherently unstable. That means that adding just one or two more events or persons at risk has a notable impact on the estimate. For instance imagine a county with 10 people. In one year, perhaps none die, in the next year one dies, and in the third year three die. The mortality rate is estimated at 0%, 10% and 30%, when none of those seems very plausible as an average expected mortality. The problem is the estimate of mortality rate is derived from too little data.

In practice, public health agencies often suppress data when counts are small, both out of concern for confidentiality, but also because the resulting estimates are so unstable as to be potentially misleading.  We have already discussed two approaches to address data sparsity and the resulting parameter *instability* or *imprecision*:

* Aggregate over more time to increase the opportunity for events, or extend the amount of person-time
* Aggregate over geographic units to pool together larger populations. For example data for mortality may be too sparse at the census tract level but might be stable after pooling all tracts to their respective county level.

We will spend the next several weeks exploring a range of methods that together constitute a third option: *statistical smoothing or stabilization*. These tools use the amount of information (as a function of sample size) to smooth extreme highs and extreme lows in an effort to recover a plausible '*true*' amount of spatial heterogeneity. A critical goal of disease rate stabilization is that we do not smooth any more than is necessary, so that *true highs and lows* persist, but *spurious or unstable* values are adjusted.  

This week we will use aspatial or global *Empirical Bayes* estimators as our first approach to parameter stabilization. In future weeks we will explore *spatial Empirical Bayes*, *kernel density estimators*, and *fully Bayesian estimators* as additional strategies for producing maps that highlights the *signal of spatial heterogeneity* net of the *noise from random error*. 

#### The problem and approach to confounding

Confounding in epidemiology refers to a specific causal structure, wherein the association between a putative exposure and a target disease outcome is spuriously biased because of a backdoor path through one or more confounders.  In disease mapping we do not have a formal '*exposure*', with *place* perhaps being a stand-in for unmeasured attributes that vary through space.  Therefore we probably should not call this *confounding* in the strictest sense of the word. 

Instead you can imagine that there are covariates that are simply a *nuisance*. That means they explain some amount of spatial heterogeneity, but you as the epidemiologist are not particularly interested in their role as an explanation; instead you wish to know if there is still heterogeneity above and beyond those covariates.  For example consider comparison of mortality rates by state: 

State  | Crude mortality rate (per 100,000) | Age-adjusted mortality rate (per 100,000)
--------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------
Florida |957.3 |	666.6
Alaska | 605.7 |	745.6

Using the crude mortality rate, it is clear that Florida has a mortality rate perhaps 30% higher than Alaska, suggesting something really awful is going on in Florida! However once we adjust or standardize by age, it is actually Alaska that has a slightly higher mortality rate. Depending on your purpose both numbers are useful, but if mapping mortality across states, you might think that differences in age-structure (e.g. many more retirees in Florida than Alaska) is a nuisance to accomplishing the goal; so for disease mapping an age-adjusted estimate may be more useful.

The strategies in spatial epidemiology for addressing confounding (e.g. removing the effects of nuisance variables) is similar to those in non-spatial epidemiology. Standardization, stratification, and regression control are conventional tools.  In disease mapping it is quite common to use standardization as a tool to balance or condition on one or more covariates, such as age. However there are methods including the fully Bayesian models and later spatial regression models, where it is possible to control for multiple covariates.

#### The problem and approach to MAUP

[In this interesting article](https://theconversation.com/how-zip-codes-nearly-masked-the-lead-problem-in-flint-65626) about the Flint water-lead crisis, a geographer, Richard Sadler, describes mapping some lead-level data from Flint early in the process.  There had been some alarms raised about high levels of lead in Flint, but state-based reporting did not identify or detect anomalies.  As the geographer points out, this was likely because state-based reporting was based on (aggregated to) zip codes.  While zip codes are not ideal geographic units for any disease mapping, it may not be apparent exactly why zip codes could have led public health officials astray in Flint. Until you look at the map of zip code boundaries overlaid city boundaries.



```{r echo = F, fig.cap='Zip code boundaries in Flint, Michigan'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/flint-maup.jpg', dpi = NA)
```


As you can see, there are seven zip codes in the Flint area, but only two of them are fully contained within the city limits. The others seem evenly split between areas *inside the city limits* and *outside the city*.  This became important because the water system issues that produced excess lead exposure *were constrained to households inside the city limits*.  The net result was that aggregation of events (high blood lead levels) and population at risk within each zip code area contained a mix of truly exposed and unexposed households. The zip code reporting masked or obscured the true elevations, diluting the early warnings of a problem.

This is a powerful example of the concern referred to by geographers as the *modifiable areal unit problem* (MAUP). Epidemiologists may be familiar with a related idea: the ecologic fallacy or ecologic bias. The problem is not inherently about aggregation. Instead the problem arises when the *way data are aggregated* results in a mixing of different types of people, producing a kind of cross-level confounding.  In Flint this meant diluting the population with people exposed to clean water, but it could also result from enriching a specific region with people with confounding risk factors, producing a spurious estimate of the true experience of health within the area.

There are two ways that the MAUP can occur:

1. **Arbitrary zoning** or boundaries to create aggregates. This is the case in Flint, where one (arbitrary) zoning system (zip codes) was applied to a different zoning system (e.g. municipal city boundaries). The result is a mis-alignment between what is actually happening and the way we count it up.
2. **Arbitrary scale** or level of aggregation. This occurs when we aggregate to a level or scale that is different from the level or scale at which population health is generated. There is no single '*right*' scale. It depends on the process of interest. The '*correct*' scale for understanding the effect of Medicaid expansion under the ACA is likely different from the '*correct*' or best scale for understanding the role of healthy commercial food retailers on obesity.

One key take away from the above discussion is that the *bias* from the MAUP arises when the way we carry out an analysis does not align with the way that health occurs.  In other words, not all aggregation or zoning are similarly harmful. The work for the spatial epidemiologist is to consider how aligned (or mis-aligned) the available aggregation is with respect to the hypothetical process. Sometimes it is possible to explore sensitivity of results to choice of scale or zoning but repeating analyses with alternative boundaries or scales. 

### Using statistics and probability models to improve disease mapping

In epidemiology, we spend a lot of time trying to disentangle '*noise*' from '*signal*' in collections of data and their relationships.  This is evident in our focus on two broad buckets of error: *random error* that comes from chance and is related to sample size; and *systematic error* that comes from structural bias (e.g. confounding, selection, misclassification/measurement error) that is not driven by sample size and is therefore not fixed by increasing sample size).

To make inference (make meaning or decisions) from data that take account of random error we adopt statistical probability models that describe the role of chance alone in generating values. For instance many statistics operate under assumptions related to Gaussian or normal distributions. We also rely on Poisson and binomial distributions to evaluate variation and differences for count and binary data respectively.

#### How are statistics different in space?

Spatial statistics is a huge field, well broader than what we will cover this week, or this entire semester. However it is worth introducing a few key ideas to motivate the statistics we will be using. 

Health events typically occur at the level of the individual, and individuals can be referenced with respect to their location in space. Consider, for example a study region represented by the blue square in the image below. There is a population distributed across the region, occupying any particular $x,y$ location.  In this population defined by geographic bounds, there may be some individuals experiencing a health event. The set of points observed at a point in time represents a specific realization of a *spatial point process*. In other words we can imagine each individual having some random chance of experiencing the event, and the set of events indexed by their location is one realization or version of the random process.


```{r echo = F, fig.cap='Spatial point process'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/point-process.png', dpi = NA)
```

To describe or quantify what is observed we could describe the *spatial disease intensity* of the event as a spatially continuous surface. In other words for every location, the intensity is the amount of disease per unit-area.  To calculate a single, global, measure of spatial intensity for the figure above we divide events by area:

$\frac{events}{Area}=\frac{14}{4km^{2}}=\frac{3.5}{km^{2}}$

In this simplistic case we assumed the population at risk was evenly distributed across the study region. More realistically, we can normalize events to the spatially-varying population at risk to quantify the *spatial intensity* of disease.

```{r echo = F, fig.cap='Approximating intensity with areal aggregates'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/point-process-2.png', dpi = NA)
```

Because we often do not have the exact $x,y$ location of every person at risk and every health event, we cannot observe the full *spatial point process* and thus cannot estimate the continuous *spatial intensity surface*.  However, we can approximate the *spatial intensity* by aggregating health events and population and summarizing the ratio (e.g. as risk, rate, prevalence) per areal unit. In the figure above, each rectangle contains $n=100$ person-years at risk, producing the following disease rates estimating the spatial intensity of disease:

Region | $\frac{events}{population}$ | Estimate
------|-----------------|---------------
A  | $\frac{6}{100}$ | 6%
B  | $\frac{2}{100}$ | 2%
C  | $\frac{5}{100}$ | 5%
D  | $\frac{10}{100}$ | 10%

When we have data in this form (e.g. counts of events and counts of population), we can use one of several parametric statistical probability distributions common in epidemiology including *Poisson*, *binomial*, and *negative binomial*. 


```{block2, type = 'rmdnote'}
**Why are probability distributions useful?**

Because they provide a model for describing what to expect fro data due to random chance alone. Specifically, relating the count of disease events to a probability distribution permits the calculation of standard errors or confidence intervals expressing the precision or certainty in an estimate. Alternatively we could calculate a *p-value* as a means to test evidence for consistency with a null hypothesis.
```


Here is a brief summary of probability distributions common to disease mapping:

Distribution | Paramaterization |  MLE and comments
-------------|---------------------|---------------------------
Binomial | $Y_i|r_i\sim Bin(N_i,r_i)$ | $\hat{r_i}=\frac{Y_i}{N_i}$
Poisson | $Y_i|\theta_i\sim Poisson(E_i\theta_i)$ | $\theta_i = \frac{Y_i}{E_i}$
Poisson-gamma mixture (a.k.a negative binomial) | $Y_i|\theta_i\sim Poisson(E_i\theta_i)$, $\theta_i \sim gamma(\alpha, \beta)$ | Note the gamma distribution explains *how much* the $\theta_i$ varies. In Bayesian framework the gamma is a *prior* for $\theta$.

In the formulas above:

* $Y_i$ is the count of health events in the $i_{th}$ areal unit
* $N_i$ is the count of population at risk in the $i_{th}$ areal unit
* $r_i$ is the risk in the $i_{th}$ areal unit
* $E_i$ is the *expected* count, which is calculated as $N_i\times r$, where $r$ is an overall reference level of risk. So *expected* simply means the burden of disease in the $i_{th}$ areal unit if they experienced the reference risk.
* $\theta_i$ is the *relative risk* in the $i_{th}$ areal unit; this is essentially the relative deviation of this region from the expected.

Don't panic looking at these formulas. Here are some take away points:

* __Poisson distribution__ is a classic distribution to use for evaluating *counts* of events possibly offsetting by the time-at-risk or person-years. 
  + Poisson assumes that the *mean* of the distribution is the same as the *variance* of the distribution.
  + Poisson distribution only approximates the disease intensity rate well for *rare disease processes*. Therefore Poisson is not a good choice if the outcome is not rare.
* __Binomial distribution__ is useful for characterizing disease occurrence for *non-rare* or common disease processes.
* __Poisson-gamma Mixture__ may be the most foreign. However, you may have heard of the Negative Binomial distribution for count data? Poisson-gamma mixture is essentially a negative binomial model. It is a probability distribution like the Poisson, except without the expectation that the *mean* is equal to the *variance*. In other words it is robust to what is called *over-dispersion*, when the variation in the count is greater than expected under the Poisson. 
  + Over-dispersion is quite common in spatial epidemiology because there often are unobserved factors driving the occurrence of disease in each area, and those unobserved differences produce event intensity that is not strictly Poisson in nature. We will use Poisson-gamma for this reason.



If you want to learn more about *Poisson point processes* or *probability distributions for spatial epidemiology*, I highly recommend Lance Waller's text, *Applied Spatial Statistics for Public Health Data* (Waller & Gotway, 2004). It is available electronically via Woodruff Library. 



## Spatial Analysis in Epidemiology, w4

As an example dataset, for the next four weeks of disease mapping we will aim to estimate the *spatial heterogeneity* at the county level of the occurrence of *very low birthweight* (VLBW; weight at birth < 1500 grams) babies in 2018-2019. These data were derived from the [Georgia OASIS website](https://oasis.state.ga.us/). This outcome is of public health importance because of the high morbidity and mortality associated with being born so early or so small. However, with an overall rate of VLBW of only 1.8%, it is a rare outcome, and there will likely be sparse data for many rural counties.



```{r include = F}
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
library(tmap)
vlbw <- st_read('../DATA/VLBW-GA/ga-vlbw.gpkg') %>%
  mutate(rate = VLBW / TOT * 100)

age <- st_read('../DATA/VLBW-GA/ga-vlbw-age.gpkg')
```

```{r echo = F}
m1 <- vlbw %>%
  tm_shape() +
  tm_fill('rate', 
          style = 'quantile',
          palette = 'BuPu',
          title = '% VLBW') +
  tm_borders() +
  tm_layout(main.title = 'VLBW in Georgia, 2018-2019',
            inner.margins = c(0.02, 0.02, 0.1, 0.05),
            legend.format = list(digits = 1))

m2 <- vlbw %>%
  mutate(rate = ifelse(VLBW < 10, NA, rate)) %>%
  tm_shape() +
  tm_fill('rate', 
          style = 'quantile',
          palette = 'BuPu',
          title = '% VLBW') +
  tm_borders() +
  tm_layout(main.title = 'VLBW in Georgia, 2018-2019\n(Suppress events < 10)',
            inner.margins = c(0.02, 0.02, 0.2, 0.05),
            legend.format = list(digits = 1))

tmap_arrange(m1, m2)
```


In the maps above, we can visualize the *observed* VLBW prevalence as well as the prevalence restricted only to counties meeting the NCHS suppression rule for natality records (e.g. suppress reporting of any count < 10). In the map on the right 85 of the 159 counties of Georgia would have suppressed data. This suggests that, even when we know the values (e.g. they aren't suppressed) we should be thinking about issues of *imprecision* or *instability* in the estimates (and therefore in the map overall) because so many counties have such sparse data.


```{block2, type = 'rmdcomment'}
There are four **disease mapping objectives** we wish to accomplish to more fully describe these data:

1. Test whether there is statistical evidence for *spatial heterogeneity*
2. Describe the precision of VLBW estimates in each county
3. Account for possibly spurious patterns due to a confounding covariate
4. Produce overall and covariate-adjusted *smoothed* or *stabilized* rate estimates using global Empirical Bayes.
```


### Disease mapping: Is there spatial heterogeneity?

#### Calculating expected counts and the SMR

Up until now we have primarily represented disease burden using risks, rates, or prevalence. However, as we introduce statistical estimation under Poisson and Poisson-gamma (negative binomial), we are often testing whether an area deviates *from the expected value*.  A natural way to represent this deviation is by using *Standardized Morbidity Ratios* (SMRs) as an alternative to risks or rates:

$SMR_i=\frac{Y_i}{E_i}$


The standardized morbidity ratio (could also be standardized *mortality*, *incidence*, or *prevalence* depending on what is being counted) is a measure of *relative excess risk*. It quantifies the deviation of a population parameter (in this case the live birth risk of very low birthweight for a geographically-defined population) from a reference value (in this case the VLBW risk for the whole state of Georgia). The SMR is calculated as the *Observed* count of events, $Y_i$, over the *Expected* count, $E_i$, of events.

Calculating *expected* counts of VLBW events in these data is straightforward: first calculate the overall risk, $r$, and then multiply that by the population at risk in each county, $N_i$, to get the events expected if there were homogeneity in risk, or if the $SMR=1.0$ for all counties.

```{r}
# the overall ratio of events to population is the global risk
risk <- sum(vlbw$VLBW) / sum(vlbw$TOT) 


# Now add a variable to the dataset representing expected count and SMR
vlbw <- vlbw %>%
  mutate(expect = risk * TOT,
         SMR = VLBW / expect)

```


As you can see in the maps below, the SMR represents the same unerlying pattern, but simply does so on a different scale, that of *relative excess risk* rather than *absolute risk*.

```{r echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
ga <- vlbw %>%
  mutate(state = substr(GEOID, 1, 2)) %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarise(pop = sum(TOT))

m1 <- vlbw %>%
  tm_shape() +
  tm_fill('rate', 
          style = 'quantile',
          palette = 'BuPu',
          title = '% VLBW') +
  tm_borders() +
  tm_layout(main.title = 'Risk of VLBW in Georgia',
            inner.margins = c(0.02, 0.02, 0.1, 0.05),
            legend.format = list(digits = 1))+
  tm_shape(ga) +
  tm_borders(lwd = 2, col = 'black')

smr_map <- tm_shape(vlbw) +
  tm_fill('SMR',
          style = 'fixed', 
          palette = '-RdYlBu',
          breaks = c(0.13, 0.67, 0.9, 1.1, 1.4, 2.3),
          title = 'Std. Morbidity Ratio') + 
  tm_borders() +
  tm_layout(main.title = 'SMR of VLBW in Georgia',
            inner.margins = c(0.02, 0.02, 0.1, 0.05))+
  tm_shape(ga) +
  tm_borders(lwd = 2, col = 'black')

tmap_arrange(m1, smr_map)
```


#### Testing for spatial heterogeneity

Perhaps the fundamental purpose of disease mapping is to describe and represent the magnitude and patterns of *spatial heterogeneity* or variation in health across sub-areas of a study region. But what if there *isn't any real variation*!? For instance consider each of these scenarios:

* There is very little meaningful difference in values, yet we can cartographically represent data as appearing heterogeneous simply by choice of cutpoint and color assignment.
* There appears to be large differences in values between sub-areas, but the counts are so sparse that it is possible all of the seeming difference is due to chance

For these reasons it is sensible to start by evaluating the evidence for any versus no heterogeneity. If none, there is little reason to proceed with spatial analysis. Luckily there are standard statistical tests designed just for this purpose: to evaluate whether the count of events is significantly different across observations, accounting for the number of trials or persons at risk.



The `R` package `DCluster` has a function for a *chi-square* test optimized for the needs of aggregated data in spatial epidemiology. The test is called `achisq.test()` and it can evaluate variation in numerator and denominator under a Poisson or Negative Binomial (recall this is same as Poisson-gamma) distribution.  The `sf` data object containing the VLBW information is called `vlbw`; within that `sf` object is a column named `VLBW` representing the count of babies born very low birthweight in the county, and another variable named `TOT` representing the count of all live births. In the language of Poisson, $Y_i$ is the count variable `VLBW` for each county, and we evaluate that count against the *offset* which is the log of the number of births at risk.

Look at the help documentation for this function; here I specify the statistical model as *Poisson*. The argument `R=499` refers to the number of *random permutations* to use in calculating an empirical p-value.

```{r}
DCluster::achisq.test(VLBW~offset(log(TOT)), 
                      data = vlbw, 
                      model = 'poisson',
                      R = 499)
```
The null hypothesis is that the *relative risk* or *SMR* is equal to one for all counties. In other words, under the null, there is no meaningful difference in the risk between counties. Based on 499 simulated permutations under the null, the observed data appear *quite inconsistent with the null* assumption, as evidenced by *p.value = 0.002*.  In other words under a strictly Poisson probability model, there appears to be significant *spatial heterogeneity* in the risk of VLBW.

```{block2, type = 'rmdnote'}
In conventional statistics we often have *closed form* formulas for calculating standard errors, confidence intervals or p-values. However, in spatial statistics the simple parametric assumptions do not always hold. One empirical alternative to the closed-form formula is to use random permutations of the data to simulate the random data *under the null hypothesis*.

In the case of the `achisq.test()`, the null hypothesis is that the *observed* count is equal to the *expected* count. Random permutations of this would be to take a random Poisson draw for the count in each county under the null. If we repeat that hundreds of times, we have a distribution of what random chance would produce. Then we compare our *actual observed* values to that distribution. If the observed values are *very different from* the set of random values, we might say there is evidence against the null.
```


### Disease mapping: How precise are county estimates?

Following the question of whether or not there is global spatial heterogeneity (e.g. at least some counties have $SMR\neq 1.0$), a natural follow up would be how confident or precise are the estimates themselves, and which counties are statistically significantly different from the  null expectation?  

A function to estimate the continuous *p-value* associated with the SMR is the `probmap` function from the package `spdep`.  This function calculates the probabilities (under the Poisson probability model) of observing an event count *more extreme* than what was actually observed, given the expected count (e.g. we might expect every county had the overall risk). The test is a one-tailed test, and by default the alternative hypothesis is that observed are *less than* expected, or that SMR <1.0 (to test for extremes greater than 1.0, set the argument `alternative = 'greater'`). 

```{block2, type = 'rmdnote'}
In frequentist statistics we are more familiar with focusing on small *p-values* as evidence to reject the null hypothesis.  In the case of the continuous *p-value* returned by `probmap`, we can think about probabilities on either side of the spectrum. For instance, with the default `alternative = 'less'`, a probability that is $p<0.05$ would indicate an $SMR<1$ was statistically significant (at $\alpha=0.05$). In contrast, $p>0.95$ would suggest an unusual finding, under the null, for $SMR>1$.  The $p>0.95$ for the `alternative = 'less'` would therefore be equivalence to the $p<0.05$ for the `alternative = 'greater'` for describing significance with $SMR>1$.
```


`probmap` expects several arguments including a vector of the count of cases, a vector of the population at risk, and optionally a `row.names` vector to help align observations. Because your job is to identify counties with SMR in excess of expected (e.g. >>1), it is easier to interpret if we change the alternative hypothesis of the one-sided test to be `alternative = 'greater'`. 

The function returns the *expected count* (yet another way to get this number!), as well as the SMR (in this case it is named `relRisk`, and somewhat oddly the function multiplies the SMR by 100 so the numbers appear different!), and the Poisson probability that the observed count was more 'extreme' than actually observed.  

```{r message = F, warning = FALSE}
library(spdep)
x <- probmap(n = vlbw$VLBW, x = vlbw$TOT, 
              row.names = vlbw$GEOID,
             alternative = 'greater')
head(x) # look at what is returned
```

As you can see, the function calculates:

* _Raw rate_, which is simply $\frac{Y_i}{N_i}$
* _Expected count_, which is simply $r\times N_i$, where $r$ is the overall expected rate
* _Relative risk_, which is also the SMR and is the ratio of the observed to expected. Note that the function multiplies the SMR by 100. So the value 103 actually refers to an SMR of 1.03
* _p-value_, which again is the probability that the risk in this county was significantly greater than 1.0


For mapping, we will grab the SMR (e.g. `relRisk` but divided by 100 to make it more conventional) and the *p-value* term, `pmap`, which we can easily add to our `sf` object:

```{r}
vlbw$pmap <- x$pmap

vlbw$SMR <- x$relRisk / 100
```


#### Mapping the p-value for the SMR

To produce a **p-value map** depicting the continuous probability that we would observe an SMR that is more extreme than observed (and specifically in this case, *greater* than observed), assuming the null described by the expected count is true, we could use the probability retrieved from the previous code in a map, next to the map of the SMR itself:

```{r message = F, warning = F}
smr_map <- tm_shape(vlbw) +
  tm_fill('SMR',
          style = 'fixed', 
          palette = '-RdYlBu',
          breaks = c(0.13, 0.67, 0.9, 1.1, 1.4, 2.3),
          title = 'Std. Morbidity Ratio') + 
  tm_borders() +
  tm_layout(main.title = 'VLBW in Georgia, 2018-2019',
            inner.margins = c(0.02, 0.02,0.05,0.2))+
  tm_shape(ga) +
  tm_borders(lwd = 2, col = 'black')

prob <- tm_shape(vlbw) + 
  tm_fill('pmap',
          style = 'cont',
          palette = 'PiYG',
          n=7,
          title = 'Prob SMR > 1\nby chance alone') + 
  tm_borders() + 
  tm_layout(main.title = 'Probability Map',
            inner.margins = c(0.02, 0.02,0.05,0.2))+
  tm_shape(ga) +
  tm_borders(lwd = 2, col = 'black')

tmap_arrange(smr_map, prob)
```


While this is interesting, perhaps what is more useful would be to quantify these probabilities into familiar thresholds. For example we could use the output of the `probmap()` function to calculate custom p-value categories. 

The following code does several things:

* REMEMBER: `probmap` carried out a 1-sided test, but to make this align with results from the confidence intervals where we identified counties with extreme values *in either direction*, which were implicitly two-sided, we will look for counties with p > 0.975.
* By using `group_by(pmap.pv)` along with `summarise()`, this code *dissolves* any adjacent counties that are significant (or not significant). The result will be a map with general borders around sets of significant counties rather than around each county separately.
* Finally, by using `filter(pmap.pv == 1)` this code removes the counties that are *not significant*. The result is the desired dark borders only for counties that are statistically significantly higher risk than expected.

```{r message=F, warning=F}
pv <- vlbw %>%
  mutate(pmap.pv = ifelse(SMR > 1 & pmap < 0.05, 1, 0)) %>%
  group_by(pmap.pv) %>%
  summarise() %>%
  filter(pmap.pv == 1)

tm_shape(vlbw) +
  tm_fill('SMR',
          style = 'fixed',
          palette = '-RdYlBu',
          breaks = c(0.13, 0.67, 0.9, 1.1, 1.4, 2.3),
          title = 'Std. Morbidity Ratio') + 
  tm_borders() +
  tm_layout(main.title = 'SMR of VLBW, GA 2018-2019',
            inner.margins = c(0.1, 0.02,0.05,0.2)) +
  # Add dark borders for significant
  tm_shape(pv) +
  tm_borders(lwd = 2, col = 'black') +
  #tm_shape(ga) + 
  tm_borders(lwd = 1.5, col = 'black') +
  tm_credits('Counties with higher than expected risk (p<0.05) highlighted with dark borders')+
  tm_shape(ga) +
  tm_borders(lwd = 1, col = 'black')

```


### Disease mapping: Adjusting for covariates

While the SMR is straightforward for an overall total, it is also possible to calculate an SMR which *adjusts* for a covariate, such as maternal age, by using indirect standardization. This means that you apply the *reference rate* within each strata (e.g. of age in this case) to the population-at-risk within each county-age strata. 

You may recall from earlier classes (perhaps EPI 530) that you learned about direct and indirect age-standardization (if you are not familiar with *direct* and *indirect* standardization, it will be helpful to review old Epi Methods course notes as a refresher!). While standardization may not have been mentioned much since then, it is a tool to adjust for confounding, just as you might with stratification of $2\times 2$ tables, or multivariable regression. It is not the only way to adjust for individual-level covariates in spatial analysis, but it is a common approach when there is only 1 or perhaps 2 categorical covariates.

Calculating the *expected* count with standardization for a categorical variable (e.g. maternal age) requires that the data be arranged so that there is a row of data within each county representing the count of deaths for each of the age-strata. While you could hand-calculate the standardized expected counts, there is a convenience function for calculating *expected* counts using covariate strata that you may find easier. 

The convenience function is part of the `SpatialEpi` package. The `expected()` function expects 3 arguments:

1. A vector of the count of the population at risk, including a row for every covariate strata within every region; 
2. A vector of the count of the number of events or cases (again separately for each strata of covariate and region); 
3. The number of *strata* within each region (e.g. how many age or covariate categories are possible within a county?) 


To age-adjust the `vlbw` data, we need a different object including counts not only for each county, but each age-category within county. Luckily we can retrieve that from Georgia OASIS. The object `age` has the same structure as `vlbw` except that instead of $159$ rows for $159$ counties it has $1431$ rows for $159\times 9$ age categories.  Said another way, *these data are long*.

```{r echo = F}
age %>%
  arrange(GEOID) %>%
  select(GEOID, NAME, AGECAT, VLBW, TOT) %>%
  st_set_geometry(NULL) %>%
  head()
```

The `expected()` function will take the covariate-stratified counts, and calculate a *single* expected count for each region. This can be used to produce *age-adjusted* SMR's. Notice how the *output* of the following function is in the `vlbw` object, which has *N=159* rows of data, despite the *inputs* (e.g. the information to the right of the assignment arrow) being from the `age` object, which has $1431$ rows.

```{r}
library(SpatialEpi)
# First, must insure that data are sorted by county and covariate category
age <- age %>%
  arrange(GEOID, AGECAT)

# Calculate the age-adjusted expected counts
vlbw$expected_indirect <- SpatialEpi::expected(population = age$TOT, 
                                          cases = age$VLBW,
                                          n.strata = 9)
# Remember, if you added 0.5 to observed above, do so here as well!

vlbw$SMR_adj <- vlbw$VLBW / vlbw$expected_indirect
```

We might wonder whether age-adjustment had any impact. As you can see from the plot below, showing the unadjusted SMR versus the age-adjusted, in this case indirect adjustment by age has created some extreme outliers.  That may be a result of stratifying already-sparse events into even smaller cells, producing instability in estimates. We will revisit this below with global Empirical Bayes smoothing and rate stabilization.

```{r echo = F}
ggplot(vlbw, aes(x = log(SMR), y = log(SMR_adj))) + 
  geom_point(col = 'red') +
  xlab('log(unadjusted SMR)')+
  ylab('log(age-adjusted SMR') +
  ggtitle('Comparing crude and age-adjusted SMR') +
  theme_bw()
```


### Disease mapping: Rate stabilization with global Empirical Bayes

Everything covered above has focused on representing the precision/stability/certainty of the SMR of the observed data, possibly adjusted for covariates. However, in the case of VLBW (and many other small-area mapping projects), you may want to try to extract the *signal* or underlying spatial trend in the data, net of the random noise induced by small event counts and widely varying population sizes. This process is sometimes referred to as *small area estimation* because it goes beyond just showing the *observed* values, instead trying to *estimate* some underlying true trend.

Empirical Bayes (EB) estimation is one technique for producing more robust small area parameter estimates. EB estimation is an approach to *parameter shrinkage*, wherein extreme estimates (e.g. of SMR) are judged to be reliable or not-reliable based on their *variance*, which itself is a function of the number of events. In other words if a county has both an *extreme SMR*, and a *small event count*, that SMR parameter is less reliable. In the absence of other information, we might guess that it is extreme *because* of the small event count and try to adjust, or *shrink*, it back into the range of reasonable values. 

On the other hand if a county had a relatively extreme SMR, but had many events, that extreme value might be deemed more reliable. As a result, it would be *shrunk less*. EB estimation does just this: it uses the overall average rate (or SMR) as the global reference and shrinks, or adjusts, each SMR towards that global mean, inversely proportionate to variance. The ideal result is that *true patterns* persist, while noise is eliminated. 


```{block2, type = 'rmdcaution'}
**DISCLAIMER:** You do not need to understand Bayesian statistical theory to work effectively with these EB estimators in this class. However I provide *superficial* discussion of what is happening below for those who want it. If you are less interested, focus on the code for producing the estimates and the credible intervals. If you are *really interested*, likely my superficial intro will be unsatisfying. I can point you to more resources if desired!
```

#### A bit about Bayes...

You may have learned Bayes Theorem in statistics, but may not have gone much further than that. Bayesian statistics take a slightly different perspective to analysis and inference as compared to the *frequentist* statistics underlying most of what we conventionally use.


```{r echo = F, fig.cap='Bayes Theorem'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/bayes.png', dpi = NA)
```

Bayes theorem has a familiar *likelihood* component, which is essentially what we estimate from observed data. The *likelihood* is the piece on which inference is based for frequentists. But for Bayesians, the theorem posits that there is some *prior belief* that when combined with the *likelihood* provides a new and updated *posterior belief*.  

While in *fully Bayesian* analysis, the prior is actually a probability distribution of its own, with *Empirical Bayes*, the prior is derived from some observed data. Often the prior expectation is the overall rate (either globally as it is today, or locally as it will be next week).  Therefore, when we combine our prior expectation with the observed data, we can produce a statement about our updated belief in how large or small the SMR is.  Because the posterior is typically not just a single number, but a fully distribution, we can also say something about precision or certainty of the estimate for each area.


#### Poisson-Gamma mixture model

Recall that the assumption of the Poisson distribution is that the *mean* and the *variance* are the same.   But it is not uncommon that a real dataset is roughly Poisson-distributed, but perhaps because of other processes (e.g. unmeasured predictors of the outcome) there may be extra-Poisson dispersion (e.g. the mean >> variance). 

This excess variation is called over-dispersion. It is a problem because it leads to biased statistical testing. You may also have learned that an alternative to the Poisson distribution is the *Negative Binomial* distribution, which also works for count data, but has an extra *dispersion* parameter. However instead of using the Negative binomial directly, we will look at the Poisson-Gamma mixture model, which is achieves similar ends, and is a natural fit in the Bayesian framework that is common in many disease mapping applications.

The Poisson-Gamma mixture model is a pairing of two parametric distributions to better account for squirrely data and possible extra-Poisson variance. More specifically the *gamma distribution* serves as a *prior* on the Poisson mean parameter, $\theta$. In other words it describes how variable the deviations of the Poisson mean can be.

In the package `SpatialEpi`, there is a function called `eBayes()` which estimates *Empirical Bayes smoothed* estimates of disease burden (or more specifically of relative excess risk or SMR), based on the Poisson-Gamma mixture. 


First, let's estimate the EB-smoothed relative risk. This function expects an argument, `Y`, which is the vector of event counts, and an argument, `E`, the expected count.  Note that there is also an option to include a covariate matrix, if you wanted to estimate covariate-adjusted EB-smoothed rates.

```{r}
global_eb1 <- eBayes(vlbw$VLBW, vlbw$expect)
# names(global_eb1)  # look at the object returned

names(global_eb1)
```

Notice that the object `global_eb1` that was returned by the function `eBayes()` is actually a list with 5 elements. It includes the `SMR` (which is based on observed data, not smoothed!), as well as the `RR` (mean estimate for the *smoothed* relative risk), and `RRmed` (the median estimate for the *smoothed* relative risk, which in our case is nearly identical to mean). Notice there are also estimates of the $\beta$ (`beta`) and $\alpha$ (`alpha`) parameters of the Gamma prior that were estimated from the data. 

We can now add the *smoothed* or *stabilized* estimates to our dataset and map the *raw* or *unsmoothed* SMR compared to the *Empirical Bayes smoothed* SMR...

```{r}
# this adds the smoothed relative risk (same as SMR) to the vlbw dataset
vlbw$ebSMR <- global_eb1$RR
```


```{r echo = T}
smr_map <- tm_shape(vlbw) +
  tm_fill('SMR',
          style = 'quantile', palette = '-RdYlBu',
          title = 'Std. Morbidity Ratio') + 
  tm_borders() +
  tm_layout(main.title = 'Raw SMR of VLBW',
            inner.margins = c(0.02, 0.02, 0.1, 0.05),
            legend.format = list(digits = 2))+
  tm_shape(ga) +
  tm_borders(lwd = 2, col = 'black')

eb_map <- tm_shape(vlbw) +
  tm_fill('ebSMR',
          style = 'quantile', 
          palette = '-RdYlBu',
          title = 'Std. Morbidity Ratio') + 
  tm_borders() +
  tm_layout(main.title = 'EB smoothed SMR of VLBW',
            inner.margins = c(0.02, 0.02, 0.1, 0.05),
            legend.format = list(digits = 2))+
  tm_shape(ga) +
  tm_borders(lwd = 2, col = 'black')

tmap_arrange(smr_map, eb_map)
```

Each map is symbolized using an independent quantile categorization. As a result, notice two things about the map comparison above:

* The general patterns of highs and lows is quite similar, although not identical
* The cutpoints in the legend are relatively different.



```{r echo = F}
# To plot both the relation between raw and EB smoothed AND the degree of shrinkage
# I calculate the difference in the two estimates of VLBW risk:
vlbw$ebrate <- risk * vlbw$ebSMR
vlbw$shrinkage <- abs(vlbw$rate/100 - vlbw$ebrate)

# This code in ggplot is way more than is necessary to see pattern, but is shared
# for example of how the plot in the slides was prepared.
ggplot(vlbw, aes(x = rate/100, y = ebrate, color = log(shrinkage), size = VLBW))  +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_gradient(low="blue", high="red") +
    geom_vline(xintercept = mean(vlbw$rate/100), col = 'orange') +
  xlab('Observed rate') + 
  ylab('EB Smoothed rate') +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = 'none')  +
    annotate('label', x = 0.02, y = 0.027, label = 'Mean rate in observed') +
    annotate('text', x = 0.04, y = 0.015, label = 'Point size proportional to death count\nPoint color is proportional to parameter shrinkage\n(blue is less; red is more shrinkage)') +
    ggtitle('Visualizing Empirical Bayes VLBW rate smoothing')


```

Looking a little more closely at the differences illustrated in the plot above we can observe several things about Empirical Bayes smoothing in relation to both population size and degree of parameter shrinkage towards the mean:

* The counties with the largest sample size (larger dots on plot) fall along the diagonal where the observed and smoothed rates are most similar
* Conversely, the counties most likely to be '*fanned out*' or off the diagonal (indicating a different value in the observed versus smoothed) were those with the smallest number of events (e.g. small dots)
* Similarly the bluer dots (those with least shrinkage) were also *larger* and *less extreme* in value
* The redder dots (those with the most shrinkage) tended to be smaller.

#### Estimating Bayesian exceedance probabilities from Poisson-Gamma EB estimates

By estimating parameters for the Gamma-prior on the Poisson parameter, $\theta$, we can describe not only the point estimates but actually can describe the entire posterior distribution of our estimated smooth rate. The *posterior distribution* is a way of saying that in Bayesian statistics there is not just one answer, but instead a probabilistic range of answers. Whereas in *frequentist* statistics we talk about *confidence intervals*, in *Bayesian* statistics the roughly corresponding idea is called a **credible interval**, and is essentially specific thresholds of the posterior.  

The interpretation of *credible intervals* is not identical to *confidence intervals*, but is close enough for now. While not necessary for disease mapping, it might help for illustration to visualize the posterior estimate for two counties. One is Dekalb county, which has a large population, and the other is Baker county which had a small population. As you can see, the SMR (based on observed data) are quite different, but the mean posterior estimate of the EB-smoothed RR is nearly identical. You can also see the precision or certainty of each, with much wider (greater) uncertainty for Stewart County as compared to Dekalb county.

```{r echo = F}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
EBpostdens(Y = vlbw$VLBW[vlbw$NAME=='DeKalb'],
           E = vlbw$expect[vlbw$NAME == 'DeKalb'],
           alpha = global_eb1$alpha,
           beta = global_eb1$beta,
           lower = 0.5, 
           upper = 2.5,
           main = 'Dekalb County\nSMR = 1.06; ebRR = 1.06')

EBpostdens(Y = vlbw$VLBW[vlbw$NAME=='Stewart'],
           E = vlbw$expect[vlbw$NAME == 'Stewart'],
           alpha = global_eb1$alpha,
           beta = global_eb1$beta,
           lower = 0.5, 
           upper = 2.5,
           main = 'Stewart County\nSMR = 3.01; ebRR = 1.18')
par(mfrow = c(1,1))
```

To describe how likely or unlikely the EB-smoothed relative risk for a given county is different from the null value of 1, we can use *Bayesian exceedance probabilities*. These sound similar to the *p-values* we mapped with the `probmap()` function, but their interpretation is different in the Bayesian framework. Specifically, instead of the somewhat convoluted way we interpret p-values (e.g. *"the probability that we would observe counts as or more extreme in infinite repeated samples, assuming the null were true"*), the Bayesian exceedance probabilities are more straightforward. Specifically it would simply be, *"the probability that the true parameter, $\theta$ is greater than 1.0, given the prior and observed data"*.  

The function called `EBposththreshold()` does this calculation, and requires several arguments including the conventional observed and expected counts, but also the two parameters ,`alpha` and `beta` estimated in the previous step. We also need to specify the threshold beyond which we are interested in making inference. For a relative risk that would typically be 1.0, but if you wanted to ask about the probability of exceeding a different value (e.g. *"what is the probability that the RR is greater than 2?"*), that is an option.



```{r}
vlbw$eb2_prob <- EBpostthresh(Y = vlbw$VLBW, 
                              E = vlbw$expect, 
                              alpha = global_eb1$alpha, 
                              beta = global_eb1$beta, 
                              rrthresh = 1)

```

While not necessary for disease mapping, you might be interested in how different the *Bayesian* and *frequentist* approach are. This plot shows that for this dataset. 


```{r echo = F}
ggplot(vlbw, aes(x = pmap, y = eb2_prob)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  coord_fixed() + 
  theme_bw() + 
  xlab('Probability from Observed pmap()') +
  ylab('Probability from EB-smoothed Poisson-Gamma') 

```
There are two things to note about the plot comparing the two estimates of certainty or precision:

1. First, it is apparent that they are *inversely* related. In other words as the frequentist *p-value* increases, the predictive probability from the Bayesian model gets smaller. This is simply because they are evaluating inverse parts of the same question. The *frequentist p-value* is evaluating the probability of observing data more extreme than we have if the null were true (e.g. small *p-values* lend support for rejection of the null). In contrast the Bayesian exceedance probability is reporting the *probability that this county has an RR greater than 1.0*. As such, a higher probability is more consistent with *true* extremes, rather than spurious ones.  
2. Second, they are largely consistent, albeit not identical to one another. In other words they track along a diagonal suggesting that a county with a given *p-value* has a corresponding and proportionate partner in the *exceedance probability*. The differences reflect the smoothing or stabilization due to the EB methods.

#### Mapping Poisson-Gamma EB estimates and exceedance

Finally, here is a map of the smoothed estimates **and** the indication for those with high probability of being different from the Georgia average rate (e.g. exceeding SMR of 1.0 with 97.5% probability).

```{r echo = F, message=F, warning=F}
# Identify counties with p-value < 0.05
pv <- vlbw %>%
  mutate(pmap.pv = ifelse(SMR > 1 & pmap < 0.05, 1, 0)) %>%
  group_by(pmap.pv) %>%
  summarise() %>%
  filter(pmap.pv == 1)


m3<- tm_shape(vlbw) +
  tm_fill('SMR',
          style = 'quantile',
          palette = '-RdYlBu',
          #breaks = c(0.13, 0.67, 0.9, 1.1, 1.4, 2.3),
          title = 'Std. Morbidity Ratio') + 
  tm_borders() +
  tm_layout(main.title = 'SMR of VLBW,\nGA 2018-2019',
            inner.margins = c(0.1, 0.02,0.05,0.2),
            legend.format = list(digits = 2)) +
  # Add dark borders for significant
  tm_shape(pv) +
  tm_borders(lwd = 2, col = 'black') +
  #tm_shape(ga) + 
  tm_borders(lwd = 1.5, col = 'black') +
  tm_credits('Counties with higher than expected risk (p<0.05) highlighted with dark borders')+
  tm_shape(ga) +
  tm_borders(lwd = 1.5, col = 'black')

# Identify counties with EB exceedance probability > 0.95 (corresponds to p<0.05)
pv2 <- vlbw %>%
  mutate(eb.pv = ifelse(ebSMR > 1 & eb2_prob > 0.95, 1, 0)) %>%
  group_by(eb.pv) %>%
  summarise() %>%
  filter(eb.pv == 1)

m4 <- tm_shape(vlbw) +
  tm_fill('ebSMR',
          style = 'quantile',
          palette = '-RdYlBu',
          #breaks = c(0.13, 0.67, 0.9, 1.1, 1.4, 2.3),
          title = 'Std. Morbidity Ratio') + 
  tm_borders() +
  tm_layout(main.title = 'Empirical Bayes smoothed\nSMR of VLBW',
            inner.margins = c(0.1, 0.02,0.05,0.2),
            legend.format = list(digits = 2)) +
  # Add dark borders for significant
  tm_shape(pv2) +
  tm_borders(lwd = 2, col = 'black') +
  tm_credits('Counties with higher than expected risk (p<0.05) highlighted with dark borders')+
  tm_shape(ga) +
  tm_borders(lwd = 1.5, col = 'black')

tmap_arrange(m3, m4)
```

Comparing these two maps you will see that there are *fewer significant counties* using the Empirical Bayes approach. This is not surprising, and consistent with our goal of trying to separate the *signal* from the *random noise*. This would suggest that at least some of the counties appearing to be significantly different from the global rate, were in fact plausibly outliers with small amounts of information that cannot be stably and precisely estimated.

## Spatial Thinking in Epidemiology, w3

>"Progress in achieving health for all depends upon effectively collecting, integrating, and
utilizing medical, public health, socioeconomic, environmental, and physical science data."

>"Although new technological advances can empower individuals and neighborhoods seeking
resources for better health care, they have also heightened concerns about individual privacy
and confidentiality."

>>[*-- Confidentiality Issues and Policies Related to the Utilization and Dissemination of Geospatial Data for Public Health Applications*](http://www.ciesin.columbia.edu/pdf/SEDAC_ConfidentialityReport.pdf)

Ethical concern for justice, beneficence, and respect for persons ground guidelines and practices in responsible conduct of public health research. When we work with geospatial data these concerns are not lessened but instead often are heightened, because of the power of locational information as a means for discerning private information and the risk for intended or unintended breaches of confidentiality and even the transmission of stigma to groups by highlighting health status in marginalized populations.


### Risks of privacy breaches in collection of geospatial information

Geographic identifiers below the scale of the state (e.g. county, city, census tract, address) are considered *Protected Health Information * under HIPAA *if they are connected to individual health information*. Surveillance and research activities routinely collect geospatial information for contact or notification purposes, or for reporting, although many consent forms do not explicitly explain the intended purpose or use of the geospatial information. 

While any individual should expect protection of privacy not only of individual PHI such as date of birth or name, it is not always explicit that information such as address can be uniquely identifiable and is linkable to other data. Privacy is breached when app-based geocodes are captured without consent, or when geospatial information is collected without express consent (e.g. if a research respondent is asked to report the address for someone in their social network without that persons consent).

While respect for personal autonomy dictates that individuals should be permitted control of private information, there can also be risks beyond breach of privacy. In some instances, disclosed geospatial information could result in harms to the participant or others. For example collected address information could inadvertently be released to someone seeking to commit violence (e.g as in the case of intimate partner violence). Similarly, studies collecting geospatial information can (and have) been requested by force of law to aid in the investigation or prosecution of suspected crimes. Thus the collection of geospatial information must be well reasoned with respect to risk and benefit to the participant, with appropriate notification and consenting process, and protections in place to maintain confidentiality.


### Risk of confidentiality breaches through unintentional de-identification


Once private geospatial data has been collected, there is a responsibility for data owners (e.g. public health agencies, researchers) to protect the confidentiality of that disclosed private information. Confidentiality protection refers to both the secure control of confidential data as well as the avoidance of the unintended re-identification of data deemed 'de-identified' through data linkages.

Maintaining data security is critical for all public health research and surveillance activities, but sometimes geospatial data is ignored as a unique identifier. In one instance I submitted a data request to a public health agency to obtain surveillance data on abortion incidence. The data was delivered as an Excel sheet where individual identifiers such as name and date of birth were removed, but the field for address of residence was included. An address is an incredibly powerful unique identifier, particularly when combined with other fields including age or sex.

Geospatial data can be stored separately from other research attributes, maintaining only a key for linkage in the instances when the spatial data are needed. When they are not needed, there is less risk of accidental disclosure of these fields.

Another risk that drives many public health agencies restrictive guidelines around data suppression and reporting, is the concern for re-identification of individuals from aggregated data because of small cell size and the ability to discern identity from quasi-identifiers. For example, age, race, ethnicity, or health outcome could each be quasi-identifiers in some instances when cross-tabulation make individuals unique or nearly so.

In a [study of the 1990 decennial census](https://dataprivacylab.org/projects/identifiability/paper1.pdf), researchers found that 87% of the U.S. population could be uniquely identified with only three variables: exact date of birth, zip code, and gender! This is due in part to the combined granularity or specificity of two variables: date of birth and zip code.  In most instances, reporting health events at the zip code level without respect to age, or perhaps with age categorized in coarse groups would eliminate the risk. But the take home message is that the stratification of data we prefer for better scientific understanding can quickly lead to at least some sub-groups being individually or nearly individually identifiable.


### Risk of stigmatization of place

A final ethical concern that is particularly relevant for disease mapping activities is concern for unintentional harm of persons or populations through the stigmatization of place. This can happen when a map identifies locations where marginalized populations spend time, and serves to either further stigmatize that group, or stigmatize others unassociated with the group, but sharing the same location. Such stigmatization can lead to psychosocial harms, but also can alter behavior by other institutional forces including social services, law enforcement, and health services.

Examples of stigmatization of place include the identification of venues where men who have sex with men seek partners, or the mapping of concentrations of commercial sex workers or injection drug users.  But the concern for stigmatization of place has also been raised from the point of view of social epidemiology, when  predominantly Black and brown neighborhoods are repeatedly characterized as 'unhealthy'. The potential harm perpetrated by these maps could arise from the (presumably well-intended) desire to highlight unjust burdens, but the failure to similarly highlight resilience in the face of burdens. 

Relatedly, many spatial representations of economic and racial disparities fail to name the factors that give rise to the inequities, including the role of socio-historical and structural discrimination.  By failing to name structural racism or policies that serve to concentrate affluence separately from concentrated poverty, the maps contribute to a narrative that the communities are in some way to blame for their health outcomes.
